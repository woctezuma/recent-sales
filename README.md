This repository contains:
* code (`main.py`) to compute & visualize histograms for recently released Steam games,
* code (`list_daily_releases.py`) to evaluate [sales and revenue](output.txt) generated by Steam games during the week following their release. This requires to download SteamSpy's data (`download_json.py`) everyday for a little while before being able to perform any analysis.

Examples of input data, downloaded from beginning of October to end of December 2017, is available [in this repository](https://github.com/woctezuma/recent-sales-data).

Output includes distribution of:
* price
* user score
* number of players
* revenue (product of price and number of players)
* average playtime
* cumulated playtime (for all players)

## The most profitable games of all-time:
1.    Grand Theft Auto V
2.    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
3.    Left 4 Dead 2
4.    PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
5.    ARK: Survival Evolved
6.    Counter-Strike: Source
7.    Sid Meier's Civilization V
8.    The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
9.    Portal 2
10.    Call of Duty: Black Ops II

NB: This does not take into account F2P games, as the revenue is based on the game price listed on the Steam store.

## The most profitable games, among these released in the past 48 days:
1.    F1 2017
2.    Car Mechanic Simulator 2018
3.    Foxhole
4.    Sine Mora EX
5.    Citadel: Forged with Fire
6.    Interplanetary: Enhanced Edition
7.    Fate/EXTELLA
 8.   Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition
 9.   Quake Champions
 10.   West of Loathing
 11. The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel
12. \>observer_
13. Super ComboMan: Smash Edition
14. Battlestar Galactica Deadlock
15. Startup Company
 
NB: Games with "Enhanced Edition" or "Lightspeed Edition" are likely remastered versions of older games, so they might not be the most profitable in practice. Indeed, their userbase likely consists of owners of the older game, which have been freely upgraded to the new game and artificially inflates the revenue computed on this page.
